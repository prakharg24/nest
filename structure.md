## Adding a new component

1. Create a new folder in the home directory for the component. All source code files will go inside this folder.
2. Create a python file in the home directory for the component. This file will act as a link between our demo pipeline and the component folder source code. There should be functions inside this file that can be called easily by the demo file.
3. Add in all the required instructions inside components.md
4. Check training/testing and add some values etc. inside components.md meta-data, so anyone else repoducing it can check and confirm they also got similar results.
